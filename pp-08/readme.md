# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: The design is very soft to the touch making it comfrtable to wear. The dark color paired with a little color makes it pleasant to look at, aproach, and put on.

* Behavioral: Performance matters so it's important that I can get quality sound and that only I can hear it. There's a simple resize to fit me and avoid me worrying about it falling off. There isn't any suprises when using it they just get the job done.

* Reflective: It's something I've become accustomed to. Putting on a diffrent set of headpohnes has a diffrent feel making me a bit uncomfortable and selfconcious needing to check if I am the only one hearing what I'm listening to.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. The design should have a welcoming feel. Make them feel comfrtable being on the webpage.

2. As metioned make the functionality have the least suprised. Keep things simple and where a average user would expect it to be. Don't make them spend 30 minutes clicking around to locate something they require.

3. Make users feel that the page is reliable and they can acomplish what they have come to acomplish without difficulties.

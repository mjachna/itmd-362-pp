# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742468(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Forgiveness. Show Password and a message to tell the user which of the information they have entered in incorrect. Also a confirmation if a user is leaving the page so they don't loose what they have entered. Forgot user/pass may be clicked on accident.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: User Control. A navigation bar of links that allow a user to quickly go to the parts of iit that do not require them to login to avoid unnessisary actions. FOr example a school calander or school news. 

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742468(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Control layout and spacing. Provide size of buttons and space between them to avoid users tapping on the wrong location or needing multiple taps.

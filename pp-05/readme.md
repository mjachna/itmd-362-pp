## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=63P0h0kv8tgggFDggFDJsexJsex
Your Rationale: A new console gaming platform would probably want to put emphasis on a couple things to make it sound more appealing to people, why its better then others. The addition of a complementary accent color can bring attention to those points.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32N0w0kv8tgggFDggFDJsexJsex
Your Rationale: With spring theres an anticipation of colors and getting rid of the bleak color of winter, plus being in the botanical garden alot of green mixed with a couple other bright colors fits well.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=30E090kgJqSCy8DCy8D4fcW4fcW
Your Rationale: A not very bright color scheme lets a user login without having to hurt their eyes trying to focus on the details while bright color hurt their eyes.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0ktui8++00WPfG7+fK3zt-
Your Rationale: The darker red gives off a feeling of sophistication id adition the white fits with the color scheme of every ruby logo.
